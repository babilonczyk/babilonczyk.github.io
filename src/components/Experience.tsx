                              Right now, my eyes are set on gaining experience in web3 and blockchain 
                              as well as improving my existing skills in Typescript/ExpressJS and several other technologies.

                                At the begining of the 2021 I got the opportuninty to start working on the inteligent legal aid system 
                                for a project called Lemkin. I've been responsible for implementing new functionalities using ruby in Hanami 
                                framework.
                                <span></span>
                                It was also a time, when I started getting interested in crypto and blockchain technologies. I've decided to start learning new
                                technological stack (Typescript/React/NodeJS/ExpressJS).
                                <span></span>
                                I've also finished my bachelor's degree at the end of that year.

                                2019-2020 were the years when I've started getting interested in web technologies. Especially Ruby 
                                and Ruby on Rails.
                                <span></span>
                                I've spend that time working as a Sushi Master (thats right :P), studing, getting bunch of 
                                certification courses like Scrum Master Certified, Prince2 Fundamentals or AgilePM Fundamentals and
                                learning Ruby/Ruby on Rails on my own.
